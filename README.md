### Charging tips
```
DON'T LEAVE IT FULLY CHARGED
Have you ever heard of the 40/80 rule? 
It applies more towards nickel-based batteries saying that you should keep the charge between 40% and 80%.  
Although, that rule is said to not be directed towards the newer lithium-ion batteries it is still a great guideline.
When possible, keep it in that range to prolong its life as long as you can. 
And, if you do charge it to 100%, DON'T LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN. 
This is something most of us do, but it's another thing that will degrade your battery's health.
